Welcome to my full-stack notes project!

Note App is a web application for note management that allows users to create, edit, organize, and delete notes through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

- **SQLite**: Relational database for data persistence
- **Django REST Framework**: Tool for building web APIs

## Features
